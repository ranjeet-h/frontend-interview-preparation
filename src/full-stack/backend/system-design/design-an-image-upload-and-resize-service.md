# Design an image upload and resize service

## Detailed explanation

Design an image upload and resize service is a backend system design exercise that checks API design, data modeling, scaling, reliability, and operational thinking. A strong answer should explain the mental model, the backend problem it solves, the implementation shape, operational trade-offs, and common failure modes.

## 1. One-line mental model

Design data flow, APIs, storage, scaling, failure handling, and observability together.

## 2. Problem it solves

It prevents shallow interview answers and production mistakes by forcing you to reason about correctness, security, performance, maintainability, and frontend/backend contract behavior.

## 3. Core idea

- Clarify requirements and scale.
- Define APIs and data model.
- Choose storage, cache, queues, and workers.
- Plan consistency, failure handling, and security.
- Add observability and rollout strategy.

## 4. Visual / analogy

```txt
Clients -> API -> services -> database/cache/queue -> observability
```

## 5. Minimal example

```txt
Input  -> validate
Work   -> apply backend system design rule
Output -> success or structured error
```

## 6. Real-world example

In a production full-stack app, design an image upload and resize service affects route design, database access, user-visible behavior, error handling, monitoring, and safe deployment.

## 7. Common interview questions

1. What is Design an image upload and resize service?
2. Why does it matter in backend/full-stack systems?
3. What is a simple implementation or design?
4. What edge cases can break it?
5. How would you test it?
6. How does it affect frontend clients?
7. What would you monitor in production?

## 8. Active recall test

1. Explain Design an image upload and resize service without notes.
2. Give one concrete API/database/service example.
3. Name one failure mode.
4. Name one test case.
5. Name one production metric or log that helps debug it.

## 9. Mistakes / traps

- Giving only a definition without implementation details.
- Ignoring auth, validation, data consistency, or failure handling.
- Forgetting frontend contract impact.
- Designing only the happy path.
- Missing observability and rollback concerns.

## 10. Compare with related concepts

Compare this with nearby topics by asking whether the concern is API contract, database correctness, runtime behavior, security, scaling, deployment, or debugging.

## 11. Summary from memory

Explain Design an image upload and resize service in your own words, then give one backend example, one frontend impact, and one production failure it prevents.

## 12. Spaced revision prompts

- Day 1: Define Design an image upload and resize service in one sentence.
- Day 3: Write or sketch a minimal example.
- Day 7: Explain edge cases and failure modes.
- Day 14: Compare with a related full-stack topic.
