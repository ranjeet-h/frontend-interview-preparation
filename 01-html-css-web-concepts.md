## HTML

### 1. What are the key new features in HTML5?

HTML5 introduced many powerful features to create more semantic, accessible, and dynamic web pages.

*   **Semantic Elements:** Elements like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<aside>` were introduced to give a more meaningful structure to web pages. This helps with both SEO and accessibility.
*   **New Form Controls:** New input types like `date`, `time`, `email`, `url`, `range`, and `color` provide better user experiences and built-in validation.
*   **Video and Audio Elements:** The `<video>` and `<audio>` tags provide a standard way to embed media in web pages without relying on third-party plugins like Flash.
*   **Canvas and SVG:** The `<canvas>` element allows for drawing graphics via JavaScript, used for animations, games, and data visualization. SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) integration was also improved for resolution-independent images.
*   **Geolocation API:** Allows for identifying the user's geographical location (with their permission).
*   **Web Storage:** `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` were introduced as a more modern and flexible alternative to cookies for client-side storage.
*   **Web Workers:** Enable running scripts in a background thread to perform computationally intensive tasks without freezing the user interface.

### 2. Explain the basic structure of an HTML document.

Every HTML document follows a standard structure to ensure browsers can parse and render it correctly.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document Title</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Page content goes here -->
</body>
</html>
```

*   **`<!DOCTYPE html>`:** This is the document type declaration. It tells the browser that the document is an HTML5 page. It must be the very first thing in the document.
*   **`<html lang="en">`:** This is the root element of the page. The `lang` attribute specifies the language of the document, which is important for accessibility and search engines.
*   **`<head>`:** This element contains meta-information about the document that is not displayed on the page itself. This includes the document's title, character set, styles, scripts, and other metadata.
*   **`<body>`:** This element contains all the visible content of the web page, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and tables.

---

### 3. What are semantic HTML tags and why are they important?

**Semantic tags** are HTML elements that clearly describe their meaning or purpose to both the browser and the developer. They define the structure of the content.

*   **Examples:** `<article>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`, `<header>`, `<main>`.
*   **Non-semantic examples:** `<div>`, `<span>`. These tags tell us nothing about their content.

**Importance:**
1.  **Accessibility:** Screen readers use semantic tags to navigate and understand the page's structure, making the content accessible to users with disabilities. A `<nav>` element is a clear signpost for navigation links.
2.  **SEO (Search Engine Optimization):** Search engines use semantic tags to better understand the context and hierarchy of the page content, which can lead to better search rankings.
3.  **Maintainability:** Semantic code is easier for developers to read and understand, making it more maintainable in the long run. It clearly communicates the intended structure of the page.

### 4. Explain some common `<meta>` tags.

Meta tags provide metadata about the HTML document. They are placed inside the `<head>` element.

*   **`<meta charset="UTF-8">`**: Specifies the character encoding for the document. `UTF-8` is the standard and supports almost all characters and symbols.
*   **`<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`**: This is crucial for responsive design. It sets the width of the viewport to the device's width and sets the initial zoom level to 1.
*   **`<meta name="description" content="...">`**: Provides a brief summary of the page's content. Search engines often use this for the snippet in search results.
*   **`<meta name="keywords" content="...">`**: (Largely ignored by modern search engines) Used to provide a list of keywords relevant to the page.

---

### 5. How do you use media tags like `<audio>` and `<video>`?

These tags allow you to embed media directly into your web page.

**Video:**
```html
<video controls width="640" height="360" poster="poster-image.jpg">
    <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    <source src="movie.webm" type="video/webm">
    Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos.
</video>
```
*   **`controls`**: Shows the default video controls (play, pause, volume).
*   **`width` / `height`**: Sets the dimensions of the video player.
*   **`poster`**: Specifies an image to be shown while the video is downloading, or until the user hits play.
*   **`<source>`**: Allows you to specify multiple video formats. The browser will use the first one it supports.

**Audio:**
```html
<audio controls>
    <source src="sound.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
    <source src="sound.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
    Sorry, your browser doesn't support the audio element.
</audio>
```
*   **`controls`**: Shows the default audio controls.
*   Other common attributes for both include **`autoplay`** (starts playing automatically, often blocked by browsers) and **`loop`** (repeats the media when it finishes).

## CSS

### 6. Explain the CSS Box Model.

The CSS Box Model is a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of four layers:

1.  **Content:** The actual content of the box, where text and images appear.
2.  **Padding:** The transparent space around the content, inside the border.
3.  **Border:** A border that goes around the padding and content.
4.  **Margin:** The transparent space around the border, which separates the element from other elements.

A critical related property is **`box-sizing`**:
*   **`box-sizing: content-box;` (default):** The `width` and `height` properties apply only to the content box. The total width of the element is `width + padding + border`.
*   **`box-sizing: border-box;`:** The `width` and `height` properties include the content, padding, and border. This is a more intuitive way to size elements. For example, if you set `width: 200px;`, the entire element, including its padding and border, will be 200px wide.

### 7. What is CSS Specificity and how does it work?

**Specificity** is the algorithm used by browsers to determine which CSS property value is the most relevant to an element and, therefore, will be applied. It's a weighting system.

The hierarchy of specificity from highest to lowest is:

1.  **Inline Styles:** Styles applied directly to an element using the `style` attribute (e.g., `<div style="color: red;">`).
2.  **IDs:** Selectors using an ID (e.g., `#my-id`).
3.  **Classes, Pseudo-classes, Attribute selectors:** Selectors like `.my-class`, `:hover`, or `[type="text"]`.
4.  **Elements and Pseudo-elements:** Selectors for element types and pseudo-elements (e.g., `div`, `::before`).

If two selectors have the same specificity, the one that appears later in the CSS will be applied. The `!important` rule can be used to override all other rules, but it should be avoided as it makes debugging difficult.

### 8. What is the difference between Flexbox and Grid?

Both Flexbox and Grid are powerful layout models, but they are designed for different use cases.

*   **Flexbox (Flexible Box Layout):**
    *   **One-dimensional:** It is designed for laying out items in a single dimension—either in a row or a column.
    *   **Use Case:** Best for aligning items within a container, like navigation bars, form controls, or centering content. It excels at distributing space along a single axis.
    *   **Key Properties:** `display: flex`, `flex-direction`, `justify-content`, `align-items`.

*   **Grid (CSS Grid Layout):**
    *   **Two-dimensional:** It is designed for laying out items in two dimensions—rows and columns simultaneously.
    *   **Use Case:** Best for overall page layouts, creating complex grids for galleries, or any layout that requires alignment in both rows and columns.
    *   **Key Properties:** `display: grid`, `grid-template-columns`, `grid-template-rows`, `grid-gap`.

**Rule of Thumb:** Use Flexbox for content alignment within a component. Use Grid for the overall layout of the page or a large component.

### 9. What is the difference between a pseudo-class and a pseudo-element?

*   **Pseudo-class:** Used to define a special state of an element. It selects elements that are in a specific state. The selector starts with a single colon (`:`).
    *   **Examples:**
        *   `:hover` (selects an element when the user mouses over it)
        *   `:focus` (selects an element when it has focus)
        *   `:nth-child(n)` (selects an element based on its position among its siblings)

*   **Pseudo-element:** Used to style a specific part of an element. It allows you to style a part of the document that is not represented by a real HTML element. The selector starts with a double colon (`::`).
    *   **Examples:**
        *   `::before` (creates a pseudo-element that is the first child of the selected element)
        *   `::after` (creates a pseudo-element that is the last child of the selected element)
        *   `::first-line` (selects the first line of a block-level element)

---

### 10. Explain the different `position` properties in CSS.

*   **`static`:** The default value. The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document. `top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left`, and `z-index` have no effect.
*   **`relative`:** The element is positioned according to the normal flow, but you can then offset it relative to its normal position using `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left`. It also creates a new stacking context.
*   **`absolute`:** The element is removed from the normal document flow. It is positioned relative to its nearest *positioned* ancestor (i.e., an ancestor with a position other than `static`). If no positioned ancestor is found, it is positioned relative to the initial containing block (usually the `<html>` element).
*   **`fixed`:** The element is removed from the normal document flow and is positioned relative to the viewport (the browser window). It stays in the same place even when the page is scrolled.
*   **`sticky`:** A hybrid of `relative` and `fixed`. The element is treated as `relative` until it crosses a specified threshold (e.g., `top: 0`), at which point it becomes `fixed`.

## Web Vitals & Performance

### 11. What are the Core Web Vitals?

Core Web Vitals are a set of specific factors that Google considers important in a webpage's overall user experience. They consist of three specific page speed and user interaction measurements:

1.  **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP):** Measures loading performance. It reports the render time of the largest image or text block visible within the viewport. A good LCP is 2.5 seconds or less.
2.  **First Input Delay (FID):** Measures interactivity. It quantifies the experience users feel when trying to interact with unresponsive pages. It measures the time from when a user first interacts with a page (e.g., clicks a button) to the time when the browser is actually able to respond to that interaction. A good FID is 100 milliseconds or less.
3.  **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS):** Measures visual stability. It quantifies how much unexpected layout shift occurs during the entire lifespan of the page. A low CLS helps ensure that the page is delightful. A good CLS score is 0.1 or less.

### 12. What are some key strategies for web performance optimization?

Optimizing web performance is about making websites fast, which involves reducing the amount of data to be downloaded and rendering it efficiently.

*   **Minimize HTTP Requests:** Combine CSS and JS files, use CSS sprites for images.
*   **Minify Resources:** Remove unnecessary characters from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without changing functionality.
*   **Enable Compression:** Use Gzip or Brotli on your server to compress files before sending them to the browser.
*   **Optimize Images:**
    *   Use modern formats like WebP.
    *   Compress images to reduce file size.
    *   Use responsive images (`<picture>` element or `srcset` attribute) to serve appropriately sized images for different devices.
*   **Optimize the Critical Rendering Path:**
    *   Load critical CSS inline in the `<head>`.
    *   Use `async` or `defer` attributes on `<script>` tags to prevent them from blocking the rendering of the page.
*   **Use a CDN (Content Delivery Network):** A CDN stores copies of your assets on servers around the world, so users can download them from a server that is geographically closer to them, reducing latency.
*   **Leverage Browser Caching:** Configure HTTP caching headers (`Cache-Control`) to tell the browser to store assets locally for a period of time.

## Browser & Web Concepts

### 13. How can you store data in a browser?

There are three main ways to store data on the client-side:

| Feature | `localStorage` | `sessionStorage` | `Cookies` |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Capacity** | ~5-10 MB | ~5 MB | ~4 KB |
| **Persistence** | Persists until manually cleared. Survives browser restart. | For one session only. Cleared when the tab is closed. | Has a manually set expiration date. |
| **Accessibility** | Accessible from any window/tab from the same origin. | Accessible only from the window/tab that created it. | Sent with every HTTP request to the server. |
| **Use Case** | Storing user settings, keeping a user logged in. | Storing temporary data for a single session, like form data. | Session management, tracking, and personalization on the server-side. |

---

### 14. What is the DOM?

The **DOM (Document Object Model)** is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page as a tree of nodes and objects, where each node represents a part of the document (e.g., an element, an attribute, or a text node).

JavaScript can use the DOM to access and manipulate the content, structure, and style of a document. When a browser loads a web page, it creates a DOM of the page, which JavaScript can then interact with.

---

### 15. What are some common web security vulnerabilities?

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** An attack where a malicious script is injected into a trusted website. **Prevention:** Sanitize all user input before rendering it on the page. Use a `Content-Security-Policy` (CSP) header.
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** An attack that tricks an authenticated user into submitting a malicious request. **Prevention:** Use anti-CSRF tokens. Use the `SameSite` attribute on cookies.
*   **Clickjacking:** An attack that tricks a user into clicking on something different from what the user perceives, by overlaying a transparent iframe on top of it. **Prevention:** Use the `X-Frame-Options` HTTP header to prevent your site from being embedded in an iframe on other sites.

## Design Patterns

### 16. What are design patterns in the context of front-end development?

Design patterns are reusable, general solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. In front-end, they help create maintainable, scalable, and robust applications.

*   **Creational Patterns (e.g., Factory, Singleton):** Deal with object creation mechanisms.
*   **Structural Patterns (e.g., Adapter, Decorator):** Explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures.
*   **Behavioral Patterns (e.g., Observer, Strategy):** Concerned with communication between objects. The **Observer pattern** is fundamental to front-end development, where UI components ("observers") react to state changes in a central store ("subject").

---

### 17. What are some common React Design Patterns?

*   **Higher-Order Components (HOCs):** A function that takes a component and returns a new component with additional props or logic. Used for reusing component logic (e.g., `withRouter` in older React Router).
*   **Render Props:** A technique for sharing code between components using a prop whose value is a function. The component calls the render prop instead of implementing its own rendering logic.
*   **Hooks:** Functions that let you "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components. They have largely replaced HOCs and Render Props for many use cases.
    *   **Custom Hooks:** Allow you to extract component logic into reusable functions (e.g., `useFetch`, `useLocalStorage`).
*   **Conditional Rendering:** Rendering different UI based on state or props (e.g., using `&&` operator or ternary expressions).
*   **Container/Presentational Pattern:** Separating components into two kinds: **Containers** (manage state and logic) and **Presentational** components (receive data via props and just render UI). Hooks have made this pattern less rigid, as logic can now be encapsulated in function components.

---

### 18. What are some common Rendering Patterns in web development?

Rendering patterns describe how a website is rendered in the browser.

*   **Client-Side Rendering (CSR):** The browser downloads a minimal HTML file and a large JavaScript bundle. The JavaScript then fetches data and renders the page in the browser.
    *   **Pros:** Rich site interactions, fast subsequent page loads.
    *   **Cons:** Slow initial load (Time to First Byte is fast, but LCP is slow), bad for SEO.
    *   **Used by:** Single Page Applications (SPAs) like traditional React or Vue apps.
*   **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** The server renders the full HTML for a page in response to a browser request.
    *   **Pros:** Fast LCP, great for SEO.
    *   **Cons:** Slower Time to First Byte, full page reloads on navigation.
    *   **Used by:** Content-heavy sites, e-commerce. Frameworks like Next.js and Nuxt.js support this.
*   **Static Site Generation (SSG):** The entire website is pre-rendered into static HTML files at build time.
    *   **Pros:** Extremely fast, secure, and great for SEO.
    *   **Cons:** Not suitable for dynamic content. A rebuild is required for any change.
    *   **Used by:** Blogs, documentation sites, marketing pages.
*   **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR):** A hybrid approach where static pages can be re-generated on a timer or after a certain event, without needing a full site rebuild. This is a feature of frameworks like Next.js.
